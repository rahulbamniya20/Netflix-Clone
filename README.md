To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (node package manager) installed on your system. These tools are essential for running and managing the project's dependencies.

- **Node.js**: Visit [Node.js's official site](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it. Node.js is the runtime environment required to run JavaScript code outside the browser, which is necessary for our React project.
  
- **npm**: npm is automatically installed with Node.js, so once you have Node.js installed, you should have npm as well.

You can verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
